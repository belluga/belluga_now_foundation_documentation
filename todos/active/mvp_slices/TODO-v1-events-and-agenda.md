## A) Backend Tasks

### A1) Agenda/events endpoints (MOD-201)
- [ ] ⚪ Ensure `/api/v1/agenda` contract is implemented or mocked (page-based pagination + filters + geo + confirmed_only) per `foundation_documentation/endpoints_mvp_contracts.md`
- [ ] ⚪ Ensure `/api/v1/events/stream` SSE emits delta events aligned with active filters (created/updated/deleted)
- [ ] ⚪ Ensure event detail includes:
  - [ ] ⚪ `id`, `slug`, `type`, `title`, `content`, `location`
  - [ ] ⚪ `date_time_start`, `date_time_end` (or default duration)
  - [ ] ⚪ venue + artists + participants projections
  - [ ] ⚪ invite-related arrays (`received_invites`, `sent_invites`, `friends_going`)

### A2) Presence confirmation
- [ ] ⚪ Confirm presence endpoint `/api/v1/events/{event_id}/check-in` (mock or implemented)
- [ ] ⚪ Ensure responses update confirmed/presence state deterministically

---

## B) Flutter Tasks

### B1) Browse/search
- [ ] ⚪ Events list/search works end-to-end (paged, filters, past toggle where supported)

### B2) Event detail
- [ ] ⚪ Event detail renders venue + artists summaries
- [ ] ⚪ Invite actions available (send/accept/decline) with credited acceptance selector (from invites TODO)
- [ ] ⚪ Confirm presence flow available and updates UI state

---

## C) Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ⚪ Users can browse events, open event detail, and confirm presence
- [ ] ⚪ Invite actions are available from event detail and do not duplicate invites
