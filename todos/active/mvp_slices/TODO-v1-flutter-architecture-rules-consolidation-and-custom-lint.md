# TODO (V1): Flutter Architecture Rules Consolidation + Custom Lint Enforcement

**Status legend:** `- [ ] ⚪ Deferred (Not Started)` · `- [ ] 🟡 Provisional` · `- [x] ✅ Production-Ready`.  
**Status:** Active  
**Owners:** Flutter Team + Platform Governance  
**Objective:** Consolidate the Flutter architecture rules into a single, non-contradictory contract and enforce it with `custom_lint` so architectural violations are detected automatically in local dev and CI.

---

## Canonical Contract to Freeze
- [x] ✅ **Screen ownership rule:** Screen files must not own UI controllers/keys directly; ownership belongs to feature controller.
- [x] ✅ **Scope-lifetime rule:** Controller is a module-scoped singleton (single instance per scope, disposed with scope teardown), not an app-global singleton.
- [x] ✅ **Auxiliary widget rule:** Auxiliary widgets may own UI controllers/keys only when local and isolated; once these controllers/values interact with feature controller calls, ownership must move to feature controller.
- [x] ✅ **UI boundary rule:** `screens/widgets` may resolve controllers only; direct `GetIt` resolution of repository/service/DAO/infra types is forbidden.
- [x] ✅ **Cross-feature rule:** `screens/widgets` must not resolve controllers from another feature/screen scope (deny-by-default; no exception for the 3 flagged cases in Round 1/6).
- [x] ✅ **Lifecycle rule:** `ModuleScope` owns controller lifecycle; widgets/screens must not dispose module-scoped controllers.
- [x] ✅ **Global naming rule:** Global app-lifecycle dependencies must not be UI controllers. Any global dependency named `*Controller` is a deviation and must be reclassified (module-scoped controller or global service/gate/coordinator with non-controller naming).

---

## Candidate Rule Inventory (Custom Lint Backlog)

### P0 (First blocking set)
- [x] ✅ `ui_getit_non_controller_forbidden` - In `screens/widgets`, allow `GetIt` resolution for `*Controller` only.
- [x] ✅ `ui_direct_repository_service_resolution_forbidden` - Block repository/service/DAO/infra resolution in UI files.
- [x] ✅ `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden` - Block UI resolving controllers outside its feature/screen scope.
- [x] ✅ `module_scoped_controller_dispose_forbidden` - Block `dispose()`/`onDispose()` calls over module-scoped controllers in UI.
- [x] ✅ `ui_streamvalue_ownership_forbidden` - Block `StreamValue`/`StreamController` ownership in `screens/widgets`.
- [x] ✅ `ui_dto_import_forbidden` - Block DTO import/usage in presentation layer.
- [x] ✅ `domain_dto_dependency_forbidden` - Block DTO dependencies in `lib/domain/**`.
- [x] ✅ `module_direct_getit_registration_forbidden` - In classes extending `ModuleContract`, forbid direct `GetIt.I.register*` APIs; module dependencies must be registered only via module lifecycle APIs (`registerLazySingleton/registerFactory`) to guarantee teardown.

### P1 (Second set, advisory first)
- [x] ✅ `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden` - Flag navigation in UI after async gaps.
- [x] ✅ `controller_direct_navigation_forbidden` - Controllers must not call router/navigation directly.
- [x] ✅ `ui_navigator_usage_forbidden` - Block direct `Navigator.*` usage where router policy applies.
- [x] ✅ `ui_build_side_effects_forbidden` - Block side effects in `build`/`didChangeDependencies`.
- [x] ✅ `ui_future_stream_builder_forbidden` - Flag `FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder` where controller `StreamValue` is required.
- [x] ✅ `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden` - Block UI ownership of form/input ownership types (`TextEditingController`, `FocusNode`) and `GlobalKey<FormState>`.

### P2 (Adoption hygiene and consistency)
- [x] ✅ `screen_controller_resolution_pattern_required` - Require canonical screen controller resolution pattern.
- [x] ✅ `multi_widget_file_warning` - Warn when a presentation file contains more than one widget class.
- [x] ✅ `controller_buildcontext_dependency_forbidden` - Block `BuildContext` dependency in controller API/signature.
- [x] ✅ `global_ui_controller_naming_forbidden` - Warn when global registrations use UI controller naming (`*Controller`) in sanctioned global registration points.

## Workstreams

### A) Documentation/Rules Consolidation
- [x] ✅ Update rule/skill files to remove contradictory guidance about `GetIt` usage in widgets/screens.
- [x] ✅ Align examples to canonical contract (screen + auxiliary widget patterns).
- [x] ✅ Record explicit "allowed vs forbidden" DI matrix for presentation layer.
- [x] ✅ Sync any affected foundation docs that reference Flutter architecture constraints.

### B) Lint Rule Specification (Custom Lint)
- [x] ✅ Define lint IDs, severity, and error messages for each contract rule.
- [x] ✅ Define path-based applicability (`presentation/**/screens/**`, `presentation/**/widgets/**`, `presentation/**/controllers/**`).
- [x] ✅ Freeze no-allowlist policy (`SEM EXCEÇÃO`) for architecture rules.
- [x] ✅ Define migration handling for legacy files (advisory phase + debt burn-down list).
- [x] ✅ Freeze severity policy by phase:
  - [x] ✅ IDE severity can remain differentiated (`error`/`warning`) for developer guidance.
  - [x] ✅ CI on `next-version -> dev` follows zero-warning policy: any architecture finding (`error` or `warning`) blocks merge.
  - [x] ✅ No deferred warning allowance on `dev`; warning debt must be zero before merge.

### C) Implementation (Custom Lint Package)
- [x] ✅ Add `custom_lint` to Flutter tooling and wire local command.
- [x] ✅ Create architecture lint package/plugin and register rules.
- [x] ✅ Implement P0 rule set (blocking target).
- [x] ✅ Implement P1 rule set (advisory target).
- [x] ✅ Implement P2 rule set (consistency target).
- [x] ✅ Add rule docs with violation/fix examples.

### D) CI Adoption Strategy
- [x] ✅ Add `custom_lint` execution to Flutter CI as advisory (`continue-on-error`) for initial adoption window.
- [ ] 🟡 Burn down existing violations to zero for targeted rules.
- [x] ✅ Flip P0 `custom_lint` gate to blocking on `next-version -> dev`.
- [x] ✅ Freeze zero-warning policy on `next-version -> dev` (P1/P2 warnings are blocking in CI, even when displayed as warnings in IDE).
- [x] ✅ Freeze dev test acceptance policy: zero warnings/errors; `TODO` diagnostics are the only accepted exception.
- [x] ✅ Promotion lanes are transitively protected by branch policy (`stage` only accepts `dev`, `main` only accepts `stage`) with `dev` blocking gate as source-of-truth.

### E) Verification
- [x] ✅ Run `fvm flutter analyze` clean.
- [ ] 🟡 Run `fvm dart run custom_lint` clean for enforced rules.
- [x] ✅ Validate CI fails on intentional architecture-rule violation.

Execution scope note:
- Current loop is rule-calibration only. Warning remediation in app code is out of scope for this cycle.

**Validation evidence executed**
- Plugin fixture test re-run green after adding both rules.
- Root app run remained with only 3 cross-feature findings (no new findings from the new rules).

### 2026-03-04 — Round 3 (P1 router policy addition)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- `ui_navigator_usage_forbidden`
- `controller_direct_navigation_forbidden`

**Provisional (`🟡`)**

- Historical state before `D-01`: `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden` remained the only active provisional gate.

**Validation evidence executed**
- Fixture case (`navigation_controller.dart`) validated with `// expect_lint`.
- Root app run: no controller navigation violations detected.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 5 (stability pass / monorepo analyzer hygiene)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Analyzer hygiene for lint fixture integration (fixtures remain testable by `dart test` and no longer break root `fvm flutter analyze`).

**Provisional (`🟡`)**
- Historical state before `D-01`: `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden` remained the only active provisional rule.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm flutter analyze` => clean.
- `fvm dart test` (plugin package) => green.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => only the same 3 `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden` findings.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 6 (pending P1/P2 closure + calibration)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- `ui_build_side_effects_forbidden`
- `screen_controller_resolution_pattern_required`
- `multi_widget_file_warning`
- Rule documentation with violation/fix examples (`tool/belluga_custom_lint/docs/rules.md`).
- CI advisory step for `custom_lint` (`.github/workflows/web-artifact-publish.yml`).

**Provisional (`🟡`)**
- `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden`
  - App debt: `28` findings.
- `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden`
  - Calibrated to avoid type-signature/parameter noise (now only variable/campo ownership is flagged).
  - App debt reduced from `48` to `35` findings after calibration.
- `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`
  - Historical note before `D-01`: 3 findings were awaiting scope decision.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart test` (plugin package) => green.
- `fvm flutter analyze` => clean.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => `66` findings total:
  - `35` `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden`
  - `28` `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden`
  - `3` `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`

### 2026-03-04 — Round 7 (decision closure D-01: cross-feature policy)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-01` Cross-feature policy frozen as `deny-by-default`.
- The 3 flagged cases are confirmed as real deviations (no allowlist exception approved).
- Rule status is now `Production-Ready`; remaining findings are tracked as migration debt/refactor work, not rule uncertainty.

**Updated debt target**
- `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`: 3 findings to refactor to zero.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 8 (decision closure D-02: ownership policy)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-02` Ownership policy:
  - In screens: all UI controller/key ownership is forbidden.
  - In auxiliary widgets: ownership is allowed only if isolated from feature controller interactions.
  - If owned UI controllers/values are passed/bridged to feature controller calls, ownership must move to feature controller.
- Scope constrained to lint/rule calibration only (no app warning remediation in this round).

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart test` (plugin package) => green.
- `fvm flutter analyze` => clean.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => findings pending refresh after policy rewrite (next round captures updated counts).

### 2026-03-04 — Round 9 (D-02 policy enforcement rewrite)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Rewrote `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden` to enforce the frozen policy:
  - screen files: ownership always forbidden;
  - auxiliary widget files: ownership allowed unless values/controllers are bridged into feature controller calls.
- Removed `ui_visual_controller_ownership_warning` (policy superseded by D-02).
- Added fixture coverage for auxiliary widget isolated-vs-controller-interaction scenarios.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart test` (plugin package) => green.
- `fvm flutter analyze` => clean.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => `39` findings total:
  - `8` `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden`
  - `28` `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden`
  - `3` `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`

### 2026-03-04 — Round 10 (warning treatment linkage standardization)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Standardized lint `correctionMessage` in `Treatments: ...` format across rule set.
- Added explicit warning-treatment linkage note in `tool/belluga_custom_lint/docs/rules.md`.
- Kept execution scope as rule calibration only (no warning remediation in app code).

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart test` (plugin package) => green.
- `fvm flutter analyze` => clean.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` counts unchanged (expected; message-level standardization only):
  - `8` `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden`
  - `28` `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden`
  - `3` `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`

### 2026-03-04 — Round 11 (decision closure D-03: async-gap navigation)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-03` frozen as zero-exception policy: UI navigation after `await` is always a deviation in this architecture.
- Standard lint `use_build_context_synchronously` is considered insufficient for this contract; custom rule remains authoritative.
- Rule status promoted to `Production-Ready`; remaining 28 findings are tracked as migration debt only.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart test` (plugin package) => green.
- `fvm flutter analyze` => clean.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => unchanged counts:
  - `8` `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden`
  - `28` `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden`
  - `3` `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`

### 2026-03-04 — Round 12 (decision closure D-04: no exceptions governance)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-04` frozen as `SEM EXCEÇÃO`.
- No allowlist, no per-file ignores, no temporary exception path for architecture rules in this TODO.
- If a warning is wrong, the rule must be corrected; bypass is not permitted.

**Implementation scope impact**
- This cycle continues as rule calibration + decision freeze only.
- Warning remediation in app code remains out of scope for this cycle.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 13 (IDE severity visibility + analyzer compatibility)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Promoted custom-lint diagnostics to `WARNING` at rule source (`LintCode.errorSeverity`) across the plugin rule set.
- Removed invalid `analysis_options.yaml` diagnostic-code mapping for custom-lint IDs (it generated `unrecognized_error_code` noise in IDE/Problems).
- Restored plugin import compatibility so `custom_lint` starts cleanly after severity promotion.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => diagnostics emitted as `WARNING` (no plugin startup failure).
- `fvm dart analyze analysis_options.yaml` => clean (no unrecognized diagnostic-code warnings).

### 2026-03-04 — Round 14 (plugin import hygiene after severity promotion)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Removed unnecessary `ast.dart` imports from rules that do not reference AST types, preventing IDE noise in plugin package analysis.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart analyze tool/belluga_custom_lint` => clean.
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` => plugin still starts correctly and emits architecture findings as `WARNING`.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 15 (IDE process environment hardening for custom_lint)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Established FVM global SDK in WSL (`fvm global 3.41.2`) and ensured non-interactive/login shells can resolve `~/fvm/default/bin` for analyzer-side tooling.
- Kept explicit SDK path pinning in workspace settings for deterministic analyzer/tooling resolution.
- Reverted experimental `dart.env.PATH` override after it destabilized Flutter daemon startup in VS Code.

**Validation evidence executed**
- Root-cause confirmed from `custom_lint.log`: prior failures were `ProcessException: No such file or directory` for `Command: dart ...`.
- FVM global configured in WSL (`fvm global 3.41.2`) with `dart` available in user shell.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 16 (decision closure D-05: module lifecycle ownership)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-05` frozen: UI controllers are never global. Controller lifetime is module-scoped and teardown-bound to `ModuleScope`.
- Modules may register dependencies, but controller registrations must be lifecycle-managed by module APIs (`registerLazySingleton/registerFactory` from `ModuleContract`) so teardown unregisters them when scope is disposed.
- Direct `GetIt.I.register*` controller registration inside modules is treated as lifecycle bypass/debt and must be migrated to module-managed registration.

**Scope impact**
- Global scope remains for app-wide repositories/services/contracts (non-UI state owners).
- Suspect global-controller registrations are tracked as conformance debt to be migrated without introducing exceptions.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 17 (decision closure D-06: module registration API guardrail)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-06` frozen: inside `ModuleContract` implementations, dependency registration is valid only through module lifecycle APIs (`registerLazySingleton/registerFactory/registerRouteResolver`).
- Direct `GetIt.I.register*` calls in module classes are forbidden because they bypass module teardown ownership.
- No exception path for this rule (`SEM EXCEÇÃO`); if a case needs app-lifecycle/global ownership, it must be moved out of module registration flow and explicitly justified as global dependency in `ModuleSettings`.

**Implementation contract (must be followed exactly)**
- **Scope to lint:**
  - File path baseline: `lib/application/router/modular_app/modules/**`.
  - Semantic baseline: any class extending `ModuleContract` (path check + AST class inheritance check to avoid false negatives).
- **Forbidden APIs inside module classes:**
  - `GetIt.I.registerSingleton*`
  - `GetIt.I.registerLazySingleton*`
  - `GetIt.I.registerFactory*`
  - `GetIt.instance.register*` variants (same family above).
- **Allowed inside module classes:**
  - `registerLazySingleton<T>(...)`
  - `registerFactory<T>(...)`
  - `registerRouteResolver<T>(...)`
  - `GetIt.I.get<T>()` / `GetIt.I.isRegistered<T>()` reads are allowed for orchestration checks, but cannot perform registration.
- **Out-of-scope for this rule:**
  - `ModuleSettings.registerGlobalDependencies()` (global app lifecycle registrations remain governed by D-05 and architecture docs).
  - Non-module files.

**Acceptance criteria (rule calibration)**
- Positive fixture cases must lint:
  - `ModuleContract` class with `GetIt.I.registerLazySingleton<AnyType>(...)`.
  - `ModuleContract` class with `GetIt.I.registerSingleton<AnyType>(...)`.
  - `ModuleContract` class with `GetIt.instance.registerFactory<AnyType>(...)`.
- Negative fixture cases must not lint:
  - `ModuleContract` class using `registerLazySingleton/registerFactory` wrappers.
  - `ModuleSettings` using global registration methods.
  - Non-module class using `GetIt.I.register*` (handled by other governance, not this rule).

**Migration targets identified upfront (current debt)**
- `lib/application/router/modular_app/modules/auth_module.dart`
- `lib/application/router/modular_app/modules/landlord_module.dart`
- `lib/application/router/modular_app/modules/tenant_admin_module.dart`

**Severity/promotion policy**
- Start as `warning` during migration window.
- Promote to blocking with P0 lane after debt reaches zero and fixtures prove no false positives.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 18 (decision closure D-07: global catalog + naming contract)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-07` frozen: global scope is reserved for app-lifecycle dependencies only (`repository/service/contract/gate/handler/resolver/storage/bootstrap-state`).
- `*Controller` naming is forbidden in global scope. If something is global, it cannot be modeled as a UI controller.
- If an object currently named `*Controller` truly needs app-lifecycle ownership, it must be reclassified/renamed to a non-UI type (`*Service`, `*Gate`, `*Coordinator`, `*Orchestrator`) with an explicit contract when appropriate.
- If it is a UI flow/state owner, it must be module-scoped and registered by module lifecycle APIs (D-05/D-06), never as global.

**Allowed global registration points (explicit)**
- `lib/main.dart` bootstrap registration for `ApplicationContract`.
- `ModuleSettings.registerGlobalDependencies()` and private helpers called exclusively from it.
- `AppDataRepository.init()` registration of `AppData` runtime snapshot (bootstrap state), until architecture migration defines alternative ownership.

**Forbidden global registration points**
- Any new `GetIt.I.register*` usage outside the allowed points above.
- Any global registration for types ending in `Controller` (including interfaces/contracts with controller naming).

**Current known classification targets**
- `LocationPermissionController` (`ModuleSettings` global registration) -> classify as:
  - module-scoped UI controller, or
  - global non-UI app service with renamed type.
- `PushOptionsController` (`ModuleSettings` global registration) -> classify as:
  - module-scoped UI controller, or
  - global non-UI app service/gate with renamed type.

**Implementation contract (no deviation)**
- Before migration, create/update a catalog section in this TODO (or linked canonical doc) listing each global dependency with:
  - owner point (`main` / `ModuleSettings` / bootstrap repository),
  - classification (`global-app-lifecycle` vs `module-ui`),
  - naming compliance (`compliant`/`rename-required`),
  - migration action.
- Introduce lint `global_ui_controller_naming_forbidden` as `warning` during migration.
- Promote to blocking only when global catalog has zero `rename-required` entries.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Catalog exists and covers all current global registrations.
- No unresolved ambiguity for `LocationPermissionController` and `PushOptionsController` (each must have explicit target classification path).
- No new global registration points are introduced outside the sanctioned list.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 19 (decision closure D-08: CI lane baseline for blocking gate)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-08` frozen: lane `next-version -> dev` is blocking for architecture custom-lint (P0 baseline).
- `continue-on-error` is not permitted on the `next-version -> dev` lane.
- Initial advisory window remains historical-only; it is not the current baseline for `next-version -> dev`.

**Governance implications**
- P1/P2 promotion to blocking remains a separate decision after burn-down.
- Promotion lanes (`dev -> stage`, `stage -> main`) remain tracked until explicit verification/closure in this TODO.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 20 (decision closure D-09: zero-warning policy on dev lane)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-09` frozen: `next-version -> dev` cannot accept architecture warnings. Zero-warning policy is mandatory.
- Any architecture custom-lint diagnostic (including `warning`) fails the `dev` lane gate.
- IDE warning severity remains a developer UX choice only; it does not reduce CI strictness.

**Implementation contract**
- CI command/path for architecture lint must run in blocking mode for warnings (no `continue-on-error` and no warning bypass flags).
- No exception list, no temporary suppression path in `dev` lane.

**Governance implications**
- Backlog warnings are migration debt that must be resolved before merge to `dev`.
- `dev -> stage` and `stage -> main` keep blocking behavior as already required by D-08.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 21 (decision closure D-10: transitive promotion protection)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- `D-10` frozen: promotion chain is `dev -> stage -> main` only.
- `stage` accepts changes exclusively from `dev`; `main` accepts changes exclusively from `stage`.
- With D-09 zero-warning blocking on `dev`, downstream lanes are protected transitively by policy.

**Preconditions (must stay true)**
- No direct push/merge to `stage` or `main`.
- No bypass path (admin override/cherry-pick hotfix) outside the promotion chain.
- Branch protection for promotion flow remains active.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 22 (final rule implementation closure)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- `module_direct_getit_registration_forbidden` fully wired in plugin + fixture matrix calibration.
- `global_ui_controller_naming_forbidden` fully wired in plugin + fixture matrix calibration.
- Rule docs updated with violation/fix examples for both new rules.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `fvm dart analyze` (`tool/belluga_custom_lint`) => clean.
- `fvm dart test` (`tool/belluga_custom_lint`) => green (`custom_lint_smoke_test` including new fixture cases).
- `fvm dart run custom_lint` (app root) => `46` findings total:
  - `28` `ui_navigation_after_await_forbidden`
  - `8` `ui_controller_ownership_forbidden`
  - `5` `module_direct_getit_registration_forbidden`
  - `3` `ui_cross_feature_controller_resolution_forbidden`
  - `2` `global_ui_controller_naming_forbidden`

**Scope compliance**
- This round implemented rules only.
- App warning remediation remains explicitly out of scope.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 23 (documentation/rules consolidation closure)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Consolidated always-on architecture rule surfaces with explicit DI boundaries:
  - `delphi-ai/rules/docker/flutter-architecture.md`
  - `delphi-ai/rules/flutter/flutter-architecture-always-on.md`
  - `delphi-ai/skills/rule-docker-flutter-architecture/SKILL.md`
  - `delphi-ai/skills/rule-flutter-flutter-architecture-always-on/SKILL.md`
- Consolidated `flutter-architecture-adherence` skill with:
  - explicit same-feature controller-only DI in `screens/widgets`;
  - explicit screen vs auxiliary-widget ownership boundary;
  - explicit global/module registration constraints (`D-06`/`D-07`);
  - canonical presentation DI matrix;
  - aligned examples including auxiliary widget isolated-vs-bridged ownership.
- Synced skill consolidation to Cline surface:
  - `delphi-ai/.cline/skills/flutter-architecture-adherence/SKILL.md`.
- Added canonical DI matrix to lint docs:
  - `flutter-app/tool/belluga_custom_lint/docs/rules.md`.
- Synced affected foundation docs that referenced stale Flutter constraints:
  - `foundation_documentation/system_roadmap.md` (`FCX-06` wording now matches canonical DI policy).
  - `foundation_documentation/submodule_flutter-app_summary.md` (updated hard-NO wording).
  - `foundation_documentation/modules/flutter_client_experience_module.md` (new canonical presentation DI matrix section).

**Validation evidence executed**
- `diff -u delphi-ai/skills/flutter-architecture-adherence/SKILL.md delphi-ai/.cline/skills/flutter-architecture-adherence/SKILL.md` => no diff.
- `bash delphi-ai/tools/verify_context.sh` => pass.
- `bash delphi-ai/tools/verify_adherence_sync.sh` => pass.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 24 (de-dup architecture wording + explicit custom_lint contract)

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- Reduced rule-text duplication across always-on Flutter rule surfaces by replacing repeated DI wording with canonical references:
  - `foundation_documentation/modules/flutter_client_experience_module.md` (`2.1.1`)
  - `flutter-app/tool/belluga_custom_lint/docs/rules.md`
- Upgraded `flutter-architecture-adherence` with explicit `custom_lint` governance contract:
  - mandatory command (`fvm dart run custom_lint`);
  - no-bypass (`SEM EXCEÇÃO`) policy;
  - explicit architecture lint ID catalog (P0/P1/P2);
  - canonical source precedence order for conflict resolution.
- Added canonical-source notes in lint docs and module docs to make one source-of-truth policy explicit.

**Validation evidence executed**
- `diff -u delphi-ai/skills/flutter-architecture-adherence/SKILL.md delphi-ai/.cline/skills/flutter-architecture-adherence/SKILL.md` => no diff.
- `bash delphi-ai/tools/verify_context.sh` => pass.
- `bash delphi-ai/tools/verify_adherence_sync.sh` => pass.

### 2026-03-04 — Round 25 (dev-lane strict acceptance policy)

**Decision baseline (`✅`)**
- Dev lane acceptance is strict: tests/quality gates pass only with zero warnings/errors.
- `TODO` diagnostics are the only accepted exception.

**Implemented (`✅ Production-Ready`)**
- CI `custom_lint` step changed from advisory to blocking in `.github/workflows/web-artifact-publish.yml`:
  - removed `continue-on-error: true`;
  - enforced fatal lints with `--fatal-infos --fatal-warnings`.

**Validation evidence executed**
- Workflow now fails on any architecture lint warning/error by design.

## Suggested Execution Order
1. Freeze canonical contract and candidate inventory (this TODO + docs/rules alignment).  
2. Implement P0 rules and run advisory for one stabilization window.  
3. Burn down P0 findings and make P0 blocking in CI.  
4. Implement/promote P1 rules (warning to blocking by decision).  
5. Keep P2 as consistency guardrail and promote selectively when useful.

## Definition of Done
- [x] ✅ Canonical DI/state contract is documented without contradictions across Delphi rules/skills.
- [x] ✅ Candidate lint inventory is prioritized (P0/P1/P2) with explicit severity policy.
- [x] ✅ `custom_lint` rules exist for agreed architecture constraints and are documented.
- [x] ✅ Flutter CI executes architecture custom lint and blocks merges for P0 enforced rules.
- [x] ✅ Local developer workflow includes custom lint command and guidance.
- [ ] ⚪ Existing DI/layer violations for P0 enforced rules are reduced to zero.
