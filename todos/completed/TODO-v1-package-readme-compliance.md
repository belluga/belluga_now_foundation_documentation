# TODO (V1): Package README Compliance

**Status legend:** `- [ ] ⚪ Pending` · `- [ ] 🟡 Provisional` · `- [ ] 🟧 Local-Implemented` · `- [ ] 🟣 Lane-Promoted` · `- [x] ✅ Production-Ready`.  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owners:** Backend Team, Documentation Team  
**Objective:** Ensure every Laravel package under `laravel-app/packages/belluga/*` has a faithful README that explains the package clearly enough for a new engineer or AI to understand its contracts, boundaries, and usage without guessing.

## Delivery Rules

- Do not mark this TODO as complete until every package above has a README that covers the required sections and the audit result is fully aligned with code.
- README content must be faithful to implemented code contracts, not aspirational.
- Package code is out of scope for this TODO; only documentation changes are allowed.

## Required README Sections

Each package README must cover:

- Purpose and scope
- Domain concepts and invariants
- Data model and migration scope
- Public contracts such as routes, payloads, events, and commands
- Authentication and authorization boundary, explicitly separating package requirements from host responsibilities
- Host integration steps, including providers, bindings, adapters, listeners, and jobs when relevant
- Validation commands
- Known limitations and non-goals
