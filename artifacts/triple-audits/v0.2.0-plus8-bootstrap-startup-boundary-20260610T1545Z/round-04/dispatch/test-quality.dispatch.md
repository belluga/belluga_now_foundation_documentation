# PACED Subagent Dispatch: test_quality_audit

## Dispatch Identity
- **Artifact kind:** `subagent_review_dispatch`
- **Authoritative:** `false`
- **Edit policy:** `derived_dispatch_packet`
- **Review kind:** `test_quality_audit`
- **Bounded package:** `/home/elton/Dev/repos/belluga-ecosystem/belluga_now_docker/foundation_documentation/artifacts/triple-audits/v0.2.0-plus8-bootstrap-startup-boundary-20260610T1545Z/round-04/round-package.md`
- **Reviewer count:** `1`
- **No-context required:** `true`

## Required Axes
- `test_effectiveness`
- `test_efficiency`
- `performance`
- `structural_soundness`
- `operational_fit`

## Focus Points
- Verify whether changed tests reflect real behavior/contract change or only pass-the-test repair.
- Assess whether assertions are effective and efficient.
- State whether the audit sees brittle test-only shortcuts or weak coverage.
- For each material finding, add category and formalizable-hint when you can judge them honestly.

## Required Result Fields
- `overall_assessment`
- `recommended_path`
- `performance_position`
- `elegance_position`
- `structural_soundness_position`
- `operational_fit_position`
- `findings[].finding_id (optional)`
- `findings[].category (optional)`
- `findings[].formalizable_hint (optional)`
- `findings[].candidate_rule_level (optional)`
- `findings[]`

## Goal
Bounded test-quality audit. Treat regression protection, assertion effectiveness, and test realism as the primary decision lenses. Escalate as blocking when final behavior, CRUD/mutation, backend contract semantics, required navigation/integration gates, real-backend coverage, CI execution, or anti-mock/fallback requirements are missing or invalid. Test organization/readability suggestions are non-blocking when required behavior coverage is valid.

## Related TODO
`/home/elton/Dev/repos/belluga-ecosystem/belluga_now_docker/foundation_documentation/todos/active/v0.2.0+8/TODO-v0.2.0+8-tenant-public-bootstrap-and-startup-boundary-hardening.md`

Reviewers must cross-check findings against the governing TODO's explicit decisions, approved exceptions, compatibility mandates, and non-goals before classifying something as blocking drift.

## Historical Finding Carry-Forward
Previously adjudicated findings are historical context, not automatic reopening triggers.
- Resolved findings are historical context only. Do not reopen them unless the current bounded package materially changes the same locus/behavior or fresh evidence shows regression.
- Challenged findings stay closed unless the current bounded package materially changes the same locus/behavior or the prior rationale is objectively insufficient.
- Deferred findings must cite the recorded follow-up/waiver path first. Re-raise them only when the current bounded package changes the same locus or closure now depends on that deferred risk.
- Unresolved findings remain valid to re-raise until they are fixed, challenged, or formally deferred with authority.

## Result Contract
Each reviewer should answer in JSON compatible with `schemas/subagent_review_result.schema.json`.
