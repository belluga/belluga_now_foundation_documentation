# PACED Subagent Dispatch: critique

## Dispatch Identity
- **Artifact kind:** `subagent_review_dispatch`
- **Authoritative:** `false`
- **Edit policy:** `derived_dispatch_packet`
- **Review kind:** `critique`
- **Bounded package:** `/home/elton/Dev/repos/belluga-ecosystem/belluga_now_docker/foundation_documentation/artifacts/triple-audits/v0.2.0-plus8-bootstrap-startup-boundary-20260610T1545Z/round-04/round-package.md`
- **Reviewer count:** `1`
- **No-context required:** `true`

## Required Axes
- `adherence`
- `performance`
- `elegance`
- `structural_soundness`
- `operational_fit`

## Focus Points
- Challenge the bounded plan or implementation for regressions, hidden scope, and weak adherence.
- Explicitly assess performance, elegance, structural soundness, and operational fit.
- Do not reopen unrelated architecture outside the bounded package.
- For each material finding, add category and formalizable-hint when you can judge them honestly.

## Required Result Fields
- `overall_assessment`
- `recommended_path`
- `performance_position`
- `elegance_position`
- `structural_soundness_position`
- `operational_fit_position`
- `findings[].finding_id (optional)`
- `findings[].category (optional)`
- `findings[].formalizable_hint (optional)`
- `findings[].candidate_rule_level (optional)`
- `findings[]`

## Goal
Bounded critique with elegance focus. Treat elegance and structural soundness as the primary decision lenses. Escalate as blocking only when canonical implementation remnants create real drift, duplicated old/new paths are likely to diverge, package-first/domain boundaries are bypassed, or the elegance issue also carries correctness, performance, or security risk. Marginal refactors, naming polish, and beautification without release risk are non-blocking debt.

## Related TODO
`/home/elton/Dev/repos/belluga-ecosystem/belluga_now_docker/foundation_documentation/todos/active/v0.2.0+8/TODO-v0.2.0+8-tenant-public-bootstrap-and-startup-boundary-hardening.md`

Reviewers must cross-check findings against the governing TODO's explicit decisions, approved exceptions, compatibility mandates, and non-goals before classifying something as blocking drift.

## Historical Finding Carry-Forward
Previously adjudicated findings are historical context, not automatic reopening triggers.
- Resolved findings are historical context only. Do not reopen them unless the current bounded package materially changes the same locus/behavior or fresh evidence shows regression.
- Challenged findings stay closed unless the current bounded package materially changes the same locus/behavior or the prior rationale is objectively insufficient.
- Deferred findings must cite the recorded follow-up/waiver path first. Re-raise them only when the current bounded package changes the same locus or closure now depends on that deferred risk.
- Unresolved findings remain valid to re-raise until they are fixed, challenged, or formally deferred with authority.

Each reviewer should answer in JSON compatible with `schemas/subagent_review_result.schema.json`.
