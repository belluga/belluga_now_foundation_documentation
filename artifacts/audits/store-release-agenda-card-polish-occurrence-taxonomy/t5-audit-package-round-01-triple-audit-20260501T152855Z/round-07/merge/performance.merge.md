# PACED Subagent Review Merge: critique

## Merge Identity
- **Artifact kind:** `subagent_review_merge`
- **Authoritative:** `false`
- **Edit policy:** `derived_merge_packet`
- **Dispatch path:** `/home/elton/Dev/repos/belluga-ecosystem/belluga_now_docker/foundation_documentation/artifacts/audits/store-release-agenda-card-polish-occurrence-taxonomy/t5-audit-package-round-01-triple-audit-20260501T152855Z/round-07/dispatch/performance.dispatch.json`
- **Review count:** `1`
- **Highest finding severity:** `none`

## Axis Summary
- **Performance:** `acceptable`
- **Elegance:** `acceptable`
- **Structural soundness:** `acceptable`
- **Operational fit:** `acceptable`

## Recommended Paths
- `Proceed: no unresolved blockers.`

## Merged Findings
- `none`

## Reviewer Summaries
### performance
- **Assessment:** Clean. Within the bounded package, the prior severe performance risks have been resolved with evidence for bounded occurrence-id filtering, early query-stage predicate application, taxonomy fanout limits before resolver work, and focused regression coverage. Round 06 already closed with zero findings across lanes, and the Round 07 package introduces no new implementation delta or unresolved runtime risk.
- **Recommended path:** `Proceed: no unresolved blockers.`
- **Performance:** `acceptable`
- **Elegance:** `acceptable`
- **Structural soundness:** `acceptable`
- **Operational fit:** `acceptable`

## Exact Next Step
Record reviewer resolutions in the governing TODO using the machine-checkable resolution table or equivalent gate ledger, then extract the derived resolution packet and decide whether another bounded review pass is still required.
